Hello there! console-log-lahesh is a command line based interactive tool to view my resume. It is based on node. It also gets help from awesome [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) and the [chalk library](https://github.com/chalk/chalk).  

## How to check
Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
Then open terminal,

    npx console-log-lahesh

(**npx** will run the command without installing it locally)
